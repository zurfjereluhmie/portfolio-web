The HEIG-VD contact page presented an outdated and underwhelming user experience. It lacked both interactivity and meaningful information, despite being one of the most visited pages on the school’s website. Our challenge was to turn this static, underutilized page into a dynamic, user-friendly platform that not only fulfills its core function of providing contact information but also adds value by offering a more engaging and informative experience.

The goal was to design a new interface that meets multiple objectives:

-  Introduce an agile search mechanism that caters to diverse user needs, such as finding staff, departments, or student groups quickly and efficiently.
-  Provide personalized profiles that offer more than just basic contact details—integrating insights into each person’s role, activities, and contributions to the school.
-  Incorporate information on the social life of the school, allowing users to stay updated on events, projects, and ongoing community engagement.

## User Research and Insights

To achieve this, we conducted extensive user research, identifying various pain points and opportunities for improvement. This research informed the design of a new, intuitive interface that aligns with user expectations and behaviors. By understanding how different user groups interacted with the contact page, we developed features that better address their needs.

## Innovative Interaction Concept

One critical aspect of the project was developing an innovative interaction concept based on these findings. This unique interaction was designed to improve engagement with the platform, encouraging more dynamic use of the page and creating an experience that extends beyond simply finding contact details.

## Iterative Design and Testing

The user experience was optimized through an iterative design process, with each stage informed by user feedback and testing. This approach helped ensure the platform is not only functional but also motivating and easy to navigate, delivering a streamlined and enriching experience for all visitors.

## Key improvements made throughout the testing process include:

-  **Search efficiency**: By adding filters for role, department, and project affiliation, we made the search tool significantly faster and more intuitive.
-  **Profile detail**: We expanded the amount of personal and professional information available on each profile, based on user demand for more context around each contact.
-  **Visual design**: Our final interface is clean, visually appealing, and easy to navigate, prioritizing both form and function.

This iterative approach ensured that the platform delivered a streamlined, enjoyable user experience while remaining responsive to real-world needs.

## Prototyping

To be able to further test our design, we created a high-fidelity prototype that allowed us to simulate the user experience and gather feedback on the platform’s functionality and usability. This prototype was instrumental in refining the design and ensuring that the final product met user expectations.
